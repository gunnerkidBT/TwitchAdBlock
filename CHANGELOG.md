## [Fork v0.1.9] — 2026-05-16

### Fixed — V2 proxy support (ttv-lol-pro–compatible format) + Basic auth injection

Preroll-ad blocking was silently broken for the most common class of proxies: paid HTTP proxies sold as "HTTP/SOCKS" (proxy6.net, etc.) that actually speak the ttv-lol-pro V2 protocol but require Basic authentication. Three root causes, all fixed:

1. **URL format was wrong for V2 servers.** Old rewrite produced `proxy/playlist/<channel>` (Luminous V1 bare-name shape). V2 servers expect `proxy/<type>/<URL-encoded "<channel>.m3u8?<query>">` — the `.m3u8` extension AND the full query string are required, otherwise the V2 server returns 404 and we silently fall through to the (less effective) CONNECT path. Rewrite now builds this format with JavaScript `encodeURIComponent`-equivalent percent encoding (alphanumerics + `-_.~` unreserved).

2. **`token` + `sig` query params now stripped** for live playlists (not VOD) before URL-encoding. The user's auth token shouldn't be exposed to a third-party proxy operator — the proxy fetches a fresh playlist itself, no user creds needed. Privacy fix + ad-evasion: the ad-bearing token stays out of the proxy hop entirely.

3. **NSURLSession does not auto-extract `user:pass` from URLs** the way browsers' XMLHttpRequest does — every `/ping` probe and every rewritten playlist request was hitting the proxy *without* basic auth, returning 407, and being misclassified as "non-V2". New `twab_basicAuthHeader()` helper builds `Authorization: Basic <base64(user:pass)>` from the proxy URL's embedded credentials and injects it on: the `/ping` probe in [NSURL+TwitchAdBlock.m], the rewritten playlist request in [Emotes.x] / [Tweak.x] (set as request header on the NSMutableURLRequest), and the AVURLAsset path in [Tweak.x] via the `AVURLAssetHTTPHeaderFieldsKey` option.

### Added — HTTP CONNECT proxy fallback (non-V2 proxies)

For genuine tunnel-only proxies that don't speak V2 (return non-200 to `/ping` even with Basic auth), the tweak now creates a fresh `NSURLSession` configured with `connectionProxyDictionary` and dispatches the master playlist task there. Subsequent variant/segment requests go direct to Twitch CDN — ad-targeting keys off the master playlist, so once that comes from a clean IP the rest of the stream is fine. The proxy session is strong-associated with the returned task via `objc_setAssociatedObject(OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN_NONATOMIC)` so it can't be deallocated mid-request (this was the cause of multiple prior crash attempts at session substitution). A TLS-based recursion guard (`NSThread.currentThread.threadDictionary[@"twab_inProxyDispatch"]`) handles the re-entry when `[proxySession dataTaskWithRequest:]` re-fires our `__NSURLSessionLocal` hook.

### Added — Subscriber / Turbo bypass

When the master playlist URL's `token` JSON contains `subscriber: true` or `turbo: true`, the tweak skips proxy routing entirely. Subscribed users already get ad-free playlists from Twitch directly, so proxying just exposes their auth token to a third party with no ad-block benefit. Borrowed from ttv-lol-pro's `isExemptFromAds` check.

### Added — Multi-proxy fallback list

The custom proxy field now accepts a comma- or newline-separated list of proxy addresses. On each master playlist request, the tweak tries each proxy's `/ping` in order — first one that returns 200 wins for the V2 rewrite path; the first parseable address is used for the CONNECT fallback. Lets users configure a primary V2 proxy with a CONNECT proxy as backup.

### Added — Info.plist ATS bypass at IPA injection time

`inject_ipa.py` now patches `NSAppTransportSecurity.NSAllowsArbitraryLoads = true` into the app's `Info.plist` during sideload injection. iOS App Transport Security otherwise blocks all plain-HTTP NSURLSession traffic — without this patch the proxy `/ping` probe fails with `status=-1 (App Transport Security policy requires HTTPS)` and routing never activates. Setting is harmless for the bundled use case (the only plain-HTTP destination is the user's configured proxy).

### Fixed — Master playlist host matcher narrowed

`twab_isMasterPlaylistHost` now matches only `usher.ttvnw.net` (the actual master playlist host) instead of the broad playlist/segment matcher. The V2 protocol can only rewrite master playlist URLs — running it against variant playlists (`*.playlist.ttvnw.net`) or segments (`*.hls.ttvnw.net`) corrupts them into proxy-prefixed nonsense and breaks playback. The broader `twab_isPlaylistHost` matcher remains for future hooks that may legitimately want to match all playlist traffic.

### Changed — Targeted diagnostic logging

Per-URL `[TWAB-URL]` logs now filter to `*.ttvnw.net` hosts only, instead of every NSURL the app fetches. Twitch's request volume was overflowing Console.app / idevicesyslog buffers and dropping the critical `[TWAB-Proxy] ping` / rewrite confirmation lines under load.

## [Fork] — 2026-05-16

### Added — Launch screen picker (Home / Browse sub-tab support)

New "Launch Screen" dropdown in the TwitchMods settings, replacing the previous flat row list. Tapping the row opens an action sheet with eight options:

- Default (use Twitch's own initial tab)
- Home → Following, Home → Live, Home → Clips
- Browse → Categories, Browse → Live Channels
- Activity, Profile

The chosen tab is applied on launch via a hook on `Twitch.TabBarController.viewDidAppear:` (`dispatch_once` so subsequent appearances don't override manual user navigation). Home sub-tabs are driven by setting the `PagedContainerScrollView.contentOffset` directly on `Twitch.DiscoveryFeedTabViewController.viewDidLayoutSubviews` — `selectViewControllerAtIndex:` on the inherited `Twitch.PagedContainerViewController` updates internal state but doesn't scroll the visible page, so we drive the scroll view ourselves and write the `selectedContentViewControllerIndex` ivar for state consistency. Browse sub-tab works via the public `Twitch.BrowseViewController.selectViewControllerAtIndex:animated:` which behaves normally. Retries on subsequent layout passes (capped) handle late-arriving scroll-view size.

### Added — Hide Twitch Stories toggle

Optional removal of the horizontal Stories strip at the top of the Home tab. Toggle is in TwitchMods settings, key `TWHideStories`. When on, `Twitch.DiscoveryFeedShelfContainerViewController.viewDidLayoutSubviews` walks its child view controllers and subview tree for any view whose class name contains `StoryViewerListCollapsibleView` (the SwiftUI `_UIHostingView` generic instantiation), removes the host from its parent, and adds a required `heightAnchor == 0` constraint on the host's superview so the empty slot collapses. Retries on each layout pass plus delayed sweeps at 0.5/1.5/3/5 seconds handle the host's lazy attachment. Toggling off requires an app relaunch.

### Added — Default proxy reachability indicator in settings

New row under the proxy switches: "Default proxy" / "Custom proxy" with live status (`● Online` / `● Offline` / `Checking…`). Status is determined by a raw TCP `connect()` to the proxy host:port with a 10-second timeout — no auth handshake, no TLS, no upstream test, just whether the port accepts connections. Probe runs on settings open, on the proxy switch toggling on, on the custom-proxy switch flipping, and on the address field losing focus.

### Added — Bits / brand-offer banner blocking

New GraphQL `__typename` blocklist entries with two strip semantics (`twab_arrayAdTypenames` for array elements & edge nodes, `twab_fieldAdTypenames` for top-level dict fields):

- `OfferPromotion` — McDonalds-style brand offer banners
- `PromotionDisplay` — wrapper around the above
- `BitsProductPromotion` — the in-app "buy Bits" prompt
- `FeedAd` — Following-feed ad cards (array-only, would break legitimate metadata fields on Stream/Clip if treated as field-strippable)

Strip is now also edge-aware: removes the whole edge from `feedItems.edges` when `edge.node.__typename` matches, matching the original `filteredArrayUsingPredicate:` semantics. Previously the recursive strip removed only the `node` key from the edge, leaving orphaned edges that broke the Live / Clips renderers.

### Added — Recursive ad-typename diagnostic scan

Every `gql.twitch.tv/gql` response is recursively scanned for any `__typename` containing `Ad` / `Promot` / `Sponsor` / `Headliner`. Each unique `(operationName, typename)` pair is logged once via `[TWAB-Ad] suspect typename=… op=… filtered=N`, surfacing new ad surfaces (e.g., banners introduced in future Twitch versions) so they can be added to the blocklist without code archaeology.

### Added — Subdomain-aware ad host matching

`twab_isAdHost` now splits into an `exact` set and a `suffixes` array. Suffix matches block the bare domain plus any subdomain (`aax-eu.amazon-adsystem.com`, `c.amazon-adsystem.com`, etc.) under one entry. Previously only the exact hosts in the original list were blocked.

### Added — User-facing rebrand to "TwitchMods"

Three display strings updated: the entry row label in Twitch's account menu, the settings screen title, and the version footer. Internal symbols (file/class names, NSUserDefaults keys, dylib filename, repo name) keep the `TwitchAdBlock` naming to preserve existing user preferences and not break the inject toolchain.

### Added — Default-proxy obfuscation

The bundled default proxy address moved out of plaintext in `Config.h`. Stored as XOR-encoded bytes (key `0xA5`) in `SettingsKeys.m` and decoded lazily on first `PROXY_ADDR` access via `twab_defaultProxyAddress()`. Keeps the host/credentials out of GitHub code search and out of `strings` on the built dylib. (XOR is obfuscation, not encryption — anyone reading the source can recover it.)

### Added — Ad-block proxy on by default

`TWAdBlockProxyEnabled` now defaults to `YES` for fresh installs. Existing installs keep their stored preference.

### Added — Typed settings keys

New `SettingsKeys.h` / `.m` exposing `extern NSString *const TWABKey...` constants for every `NSUserDefaults` key, replacing scattered `@"..."` literals across `Tweak.x`, `Settings.x`, `TWABSettingsVC.m`, `Emotes.x`, and `TWAdBlockAssetResourceLoaderDelegate.m`. Typos become compile errors instead of silent NO/nil reads.

### Added — Hook-target missing diagnostic

`twab_warnIfClassMissing()` runs at `%ctor` for every Swift class we `%hook` (account menu, following VC, headliner ad manager, URL-session client, app update prompt, tab bar controller, browse VC, discovery feed tab VC, discovery feed shelf container). When Twitch renames a class between versions the corresponding feature silently fails — this surfaces missing classes via `[TWAB] missing hook target: …` at launch.

### Changed — IRC emote position math is now grapheme-cluster counted

`emotes=` tag positions are derived from `enumerateSubstringsInRange:options:NSStringEnumerationByComposedCharacterSequences` instead of `NSString.length` (UTF-16 code units). Emoji and other non-BMP characters before an emote no longer shift the rendered emote range.

### Changed — WebSocket handler idempotent + non-IRC early return

`twab_wrapHandler` now uses `objc_setAssociatedObject` to mark already-wrapped handlers so the public `NSURLSessionWebSocketTask` and the private `__NSURLSessionWebSocketTask` hooks can't double-wrap each other's blocks. Also short-circuits when the first character of a frame isn't `@`, `:`, or `P` (non-IRC traffic) before doing any CRLF splitting / per-line work.

### Changed — Emote registry LRU eviction

The byWord / byFakeId dictionaries grew monotonically with each visited channel. Now each emote is tagged with its source room; the loaded-room set is bounded to `TWAB_MAX_ROOMS` (50, globals exempt); when crossed, the oldest room's entries are removed from all indices.

### Changed — Synthetic emote ID generator

Switched from a `dispatch_queue_t` + `dispatch_sync` block to a single `atomic_fetch_add` on a `_Atomic uint64_t` counter. One less queue hop per emote registration.

### Changed — `%@` + `UTF8String` → `%{public}@` for NSString logging

Every `os_log` site in `Emotes.x` that was formatting an `NSString` via `%{public}s` + `.UTF8String` now uses `%{public}@` directly. Avoids the per-call UTF-8 conversion and is the idiomatic OSLog form.

### Changed — NSURLSession ad-data filter hooks deduped

`_TtC9TwitchKit18TKURLSessionClient.URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData:` and `_TtC6Apollo16URLSessionClient.URLSession:dataTask:didReceiveData:` previously had identical one-line bodies. Factored into `twab_filteredFeedData()` so future client class additions only need a one-line hook block.

### Changed — Effective proxy address helper

The `[tweakDefaults boolForKey:TWABKeyAdBlockCustomProxyEnabled] ? [tweakDefaults stringForKey:TWABKeyAdBlockProxy] : PROXY_ADDR` ternary was duplicated 5 times across Tweak.x and TWAdBlockAssetResourceLoaderDelegate.m. Extracted to `twab_effectiveProxyAddress()` in `SettingsKeys.m`.

### Changed — Settings text fields save on every keystroke

The proxy address `UITextField` previously persisted to `NSUserDefaults` only in `textFieldDidEndEditing:`. If the user typed and backgrounded the app without explicitly dismissing the keyboard, the value sometimes wasn't saved. Added an `UIControlEventEditingChanged` target that writes on every change, plus `keyboardDismissMode = OnDrag` so any table scroll dismisses the keyboard (and triggers status re-probe).

### Changed — Settings cells use `dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier:`

Switch cells now properly dequeue and reset state on reuse instead of allocating fresh `UITableViewCell` instances each `cellForRowAtIndexPath:`. The proxy address text-field cell uses a tagged-view lookup so its `UITextField` isn't reattached on reuse.

### Changed — Deprecated `[tweakDefaults synchronize]` calls removed

Apple deprecated `synchronize` in iOS 12; `setBool:forKey:` and friends already persist on their own. Five call sites in `TWABSettingsVC.m` deleted.

### Fixed — Live and Clips tabs failed to populate

A recursive `__typename` strip introduced in the previous release was removing the `node` key from edges in `feedItems.edges` (matching `FeedAd`), leaving the edges in place with no `node` — the Live/Clips renderers handled this by showing nothing. Restored the original `filteredArrayUsingPredicate:` behavior by detecting edge-shape array elements (`{__typename: Edge, node: {__typename: FeedAd}}`) and removing the whole edge. Also added a "dirty" flag so responses with no strips are returned byte-for-byte unchanged, since Apollo's cache normalization is sensitive to re-serialization differences.

### Fixed — Speculative ad typenames blanking content surfaces

`AdProperties`, `PromotedContent`, `SponsoredContent`, `HeadlinerAd`, `DisplayAd`, `BannerAd`, `FeedAds`, `AdCard` removed from the blocklist — they were defensive guesses never confirmed via diagnostic logs, and several were appearing as metadata fields on legitimate `Stream` / `Clip` / promotional content objects whose renderers expected them. The blocklist is now curated to typenames the user has observed in chat or feed logs.

## [Fork] — 2026-05-15

### Added — Third-party emote rendering (7TV / BTTV / FrankerFaceZ)

Emotes from 7TV, BetterTTV, and FrankerFaceZ now render inline alongside native Twitch emotes in chat. Implementation in `Emotes.x`:

1. **IRC tag injection** — `NSURLSessionWebSocketTask.receiveMessageWithCompletionHandler:` is hooked (both `NSURLSessionWebSocketTask` and the private `__NSURLSessionWebSocketTask`). Each incoming IRC frame is parsed for PRIVMSG, the message body is scanned for known emote words, and synthetic numeric emote IDs (≥ `9_000_000_000` so they never collide with real Twitch IDs) are appended to the IRC `emotes=` tag. Twitch's Kotlin Multiplatform parser in `KMPMobileChat.framework` then produces normal `EmoteToken` objects from the tag — no need to construct Kotlin/Native objects from ObjC.

2. **URL redirect** — `__NSURLSessionLocal.dataTaskWithRequest:` is hooked to detect outgoing requests for `static-cdn.jtvnw.net/emoticons/v2/{syntheticId}/...` and rewrite the URL to the real provider CDN:
   - 7TV → `cdn.7tv.app/emote/{id}/2x.webp`
   - BTTV → `cdn.betterttv.net/emote/{id}/2x`
   - FFZ → `cdn.frankerfacez.com/emote/{id}/2`

3. **Per-channel emote loading** — when a new `room-id=` is seen in a PRIVMSG, the channel's 7TV, BTTV, and FFZ emote sets are fetched asynchronously from the providers' public APIs. Global emote sets are fetched once at dylib load. All registry operations go through a concurrent dispatch queue with barrier writes.

4. **Settings toggle** — new "3rd-Party Emotes" switch in the TwitchAdBlock settings (defaults ON, key `TWEmotesEnabled`). Both hooks are gated by this preference for instant on/off.

### Changed — Deployment target bumped to iOS 13.0

`NSURLSessionWebSocketTask` is iOS 13+ only. The Twitch app itself requires iOS 14+, so this is a no-op for end users.

### Known limitations

- **Animated emotes render as a static first frame.** Twitch decides static vs animated via `MessageStringImageData.isAnimated`, but the rendering pipeline does not call `initWithStaticURL:animatedURL:isAnimated:isAvatar:` for emotes whose IDs aren't in Twitch's emote catalog — verified by swizzling the init and observing it is never invoked. The actual hook target for forcing animation has not yet been identified.
- **Your own outgoing messages don't get emote rendering.** Twitch tokenizes the local user's own messages locally before the IRC echo arrives, so our `emotes=` injection on the echo is ignored. Emotes still render for everyone else watching, including your messages on their screens.

## [Fork] — 2026-05-07 (continued)

### Fixed — Proxy silently ignored for standard HTTP proxies

`twab_URLWithProxyURL:` pings `<proxy>/ping` to detect Luminous-style reverse proxies. Standard HTTP proxies (including authenticated `user:pass@host:port` proxies) return non-200, causing the method to return the original URL unchanged — leaving no proxy applied at all. Fixed: if the URL is not rewritten (not a Luminous proxy), both the `NSURLSession` hooks and the `AVURLAsset` hook now fall back to `connectionProxyDictionary` via `twab_proxySessionWithAddress:`. Luminous-style proxies (where `/ping` returns 200) continue to use URL rewriting as before.

### Fixed — `playlist.ttvnw.net` not intercepted for proxy routing

Twitch 29.x issues HLS playlist requests to both `usher.ttvnw.net` and `playlist.ttvnw.net`. The proxy host check only matched `usher.ttvnw.net`, so any request to `playlist.ttvnw.net` bypassed proxy routing entirely. Both hosts are now matched in a shared `twab_isPlaylistHost()` helper used by all three hook sites (`dataTaskWithRequest:`, `uploadTaskWithRequest:`, `AVURLAsset initWithURL:`).

### Added — Network-level ad domain blocking

Requests to known Twitch ad-serving domains are now failed immediately at the `NSURLSession` hook level, independent of the proxy setting. Blocked hosts sourced from TCDB (Twitch CDN Debugger) config observed on Twitch 29.2:

- `edge.ads.twitch.tv`
- `amazon-adsystem.com` / `s.amazon-adsystem.com` / `c.amazon-adsystem.com`
- `spade.twitch.tv`
- `secure-sts-prod.imrworldwide.com`

### Note — Default proxy is currently unreachable

Default `proxy` times out as of 2026-05-07. The address is retained in `Config.h` as the default and will resume working if the service comes back online. Use a custom proxy in the meantime.

## [Fork] — 2026-05-07

### Fixed — Settings screen crash on iOS 26 / sideloaded dylibs

The settings screen crashed immediately on tap with `PC=0` because `@available(iOS 13, *)` compiles to a call to `___isOSVersionAtLeast`, a symbol that resolves to `NULL` in sideloaded dylibs (no Substrate/OS runtime to resolve it). Replaced all `@available` guards with `[NSProcessInfo.processInfo isOperatingSystemAtLeastVersion:]` at runtime, and suppressed the resulting compiler warning with `#pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wunguarded-availability-new"`.

### Fixed — Settings toggle labels invisible on iOS 26

`UITableViewCell.textLabel` is silently ignored on iOS 14+; iOS 26 renders nothing. Switched to `UIListContentConfiguration` (detected at runtime via `respondsToSelector:`) with a `textLabel` fallback for older OS versions.

### Fixed — `LOC()` macro returning nil when bundle is absent

The `LOC(key, default)` macro called `[tweakBundle localizedStringForKey:key value:default table:nil]` unconditionally. When `tweakBundle` is `nil` (bundle not present in a sideloaded IPA), UIKit received `nil` label text. Fixed to `(tweakBundle ? [tweakBundle localizedStringForKey:key value:default table:nil] : (default))`.

### Fixed — Custom proxy address field invisible and untappable

`proxyAddressCell` created a `UITextField` with `initWithFrame:CGRectMake(16, 0, cell.bounds.size.width - 32, 44)`. At cell creation time `cell.bounds.size.width` is `0`, giving an effective width of `-32 pt`. Replaced with Auto Layout constraints (leading/trailing anchors + `centerYAnchor`) so the field fills the cell correctly at any screen width. Updated placeholder to `user:pass@host:port` to document the accepted format.

### Fixed — Ad blocking broken against Twitch 29.x

Twitch 29.x changed its GraphQL API in two ways that made the platform-spoof silently fail:

1. **Operation rename** — `StreamAccessToken` was replaced by `PlaybackAccessToken` and `PlaybackAccessToken_Template`. The old code only checked for `StreamAccessToken` so new requests were not spoofed.
2. **Field rename** — The platform field moved from `variables.params.platform` to `variables.playerType` (flat, top-level of variables). The old code only patched the nested `params.platform` path.
3. **Batched requests** — Twitch 29.x uses Apollo batching: requests arrive as a JSON **array** of operation objects rather than a single object. The old code only handled `NSMutableDictionary`, so batched requests fell through unmodified.

Rewrote `NSData+TwitchAdBlock.m` with a `twab_applyPlatformSpoof()` helper that handles all known operation names and both field paths, and dispatches correctly over both single-object and array payloads.

### Added — Apollo URLSessionClient hook for feed ad filtering (Twitch 29.x)

Twitch 29.x replaced `_TtC9TwitchKit18TKURLSessionClient` with `_TtC6Apollo16URLSessionClient`. Added a parallel `%hook` for the Apollo class so `FeedAd` nodes are stripped from Following-tab feed responses on both old and new Twitch builds. Both hooks coexist safely — Logos silently skips hooks for classes that don't exist at runtime.

### Added — HTTP proxy authentication support

The original proxy implementation only supported open proxies. Added `TWABProxyAuthDelegate` — an `NSURLSessionDelegate` wrapper that responds to `NSURLAuthenticationMethodHTTPProxy` challenges with stored credentials and forwards all other challenges to the original delegate. Added `TWABParseProxyAddress()` to parse the `user:pass@host:port` format (with or without an `http://` scheme prefix) into host, port, user, and password components.

### Refactored — Settings view controller (Logos `%subclass` → plain ObjC)

The original `TWAdBlockSettingsViewController` was implemented as a Logos `%subclass` on `UITableViewController`. This approach is fragile in sideloaded dylibs because `%subclass` relies on Substrate/runtime hooks that may not be present, and it was causing silent registration failures on Twitch 29.x + iOS 26. Replaced with `TWABSettingsVC`, a plain Objective-C `UITableViewController` subclass compiled as a standard `.m` file. The three old Logos files (`TWAdBlockSettingsViewController.x`, `TWAdBlockSettingsTextField.x`, `TWAdBlockSettingsTextFieldTableViewCell.x`) are retained as stubs for build compatibility but contain no code.

### Changed — `Settings.x` navigation to use `TWABSettingsVC` directly

Removed the `objc_getClass()` lookup for the old Logos-generated class name. `TWABSettingsVC` is now instantiated directly via `[TWABSettingsVC settingsVC]`, which is safe because it is a statically compiled ObjC class in the same dylib.
